### About the Course

Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist's toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

### Course Contents

This class is taught in three modules

1. Least squares and linear regression
2. Multivariable regression
3. Generalized linear models

Each module has sub modules, labeled such as 01\_03\. Videos within submodules are broken up so that 01\_03\_a is the first video in sub-module 3 in module 1 while 01\_03\_b is the second video. For convenience we post the broken up videos, and then also the full videos for each sub-module on the site.
